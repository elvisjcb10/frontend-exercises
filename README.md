This repository contains exercises I created to practice and improve my frontend development skills.

JavaScript (ES6+)

CSS Modules

Each exercise is organized in its own folder inside src/components/, with reusable components when needed.
Examples include:

More exercises will be added as I keep practicing frontend concepts.
